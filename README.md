### HI ðŸ‘‹, I'm Josh.

I'm a Software Engineer with a penchant for design. I live in Sunny Southern California with my beautiful wife, daughter, and 2 kitties in a very old creaky craftsman.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Full-Stack Engineer for a couple of companies using NodeJS, PHP, Vue, and React. I'm comfortable in Linux, have a bit of DevOps experience, and just really well-rounded for product-focused tech companies.

âš¡ My main interests are both technical and finding automated solutions for complex manual problems.
